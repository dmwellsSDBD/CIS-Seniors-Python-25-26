# Python List Structures & Strings Certification Project
## YouScience Computer Programming 2 - Standard 1

## Project Overview
Project Name: Student Grade Management System
Target Audience: 12th Grade Students
Course: Computer and Information Science
Duration: 2-3 class periods (90-135 minutes)
Assessment Type: Certification Project for YouScience Standard 1

## Project Description
Students will create a comprehensive Grade Management System that allows users to manage student records, including names, test scores, and grade calculations. This project integrates all Standard 1 objectives by working with static lists (arrays), dynamic lists, and extensive string manipulation.

The system will allow users to:

 * Add and remove student records dynamically
 * Store and manipulate test scores using static arrays
 * Perform operations on grade data (sorting, averaging, searching)
 * Use string operations for student name processing and formatting
 * Generate formatted reports with grade statistics


## Learning Objectives Aligned to Standard 1
### Objective 1: Static Arrays/Lists

* Declare and initialize fixed-size lists for test scores
* Input and output data from score arrays
* Sort arrays of numeric data
* Iterate through arrays using multiple methods

### Objective 2: Dynamic Arrays/Lists

* Create and manage dynamic student lists
* Add and remove student records
* Output formatted data from dynamic structures
* Perform calculations on dynamic data
* Use both standard and enhanced iteration methods

### Objective 3: Strings

* Compare student names for searching
* Find string lengths for validation
* Extract substrings (first name, last name, initials)
* Concatenate strings for formatted output
* Locate substring positions
* Insert strings to create formatted reports


## Project Requirements
### Part 1: Static Array Operations (30 points)
Students must demonstrate:

* Create a fixed-size list to store exactly 5 test scores per student
* Initialize arrays with default or user-input values
* Sort test scores from highest to lowest
* Calculate average, highest, and lowest scores
* Use a for loop to iterate through scores
* Use a for-each style iteration to display scores

### Part 2: Dynamic List Operations (35 points)
Students must demonstrate:

* Create an empty dynamic list to store student records
* Add student records to the list using append()
* Remove students from the list by name or index
* Display all student records with formatting
* Sort the student list by name or average grade
* Iterate through students using while loops and for loops
* Count total number of students dynamically

### Part 3: String Operations (35 points)
Students must demonstrate:

* Compare student names to search for specific students
* Find and validate string lengths (minimum name length)
* Extract first and last names from full names
* Concatenate strings to create formatted output
* Find substring positions (locate specific characters)
* Insert strings to create formatted headers and reports
* Create student initials from full names
